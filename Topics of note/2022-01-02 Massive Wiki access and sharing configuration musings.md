# 2022-01-02 Massive wiki access and sharing configuration musings

This note was sparked by a side chat with [[Peter Kaminski]] about settling on how to share massive wikis (as well as other content). Pete noted that [[David Bovill]] has this a working practice and configuration: "David Bovill's doing that now, syncing through iCloud for iPad-desktop, and git for desktop-to-cloud-and-other-people."

In the current state of Massive Wiki (MW) use, we are experimenting with two different sharing setups.
1. Using Git to make wiki repositories available to others.
2. Using a peer-to-peer sharing mechanism, such as [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) .

For my own wiki client access work practice, I want to have both Desktop and mobile (iPad tablet) access to the latest content and be able to add and edit from both systems.

Requirements:
- I need to understand how to ensure Desktop, iCloud, and Github repositories can be synchronized for my own use. Git and Syncthing will handle the sharing with others.
- To promote and support sharing: document the requirements and steps needed for participation in Git and Syncthing content sharing.

## Comments: Obsidian Sync

(Pete, 2021-01-05) For completeness, I note that you could use Obsidian Sync to sync between iPad+Desktop (and then Syncthing for Desktop to others).  $10/month or $96/year.  I haven't tried it.
