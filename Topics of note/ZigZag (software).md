# ZigZag (software)

> **ZigZag** is a data model, invented by [[Person/Ted Nelson]], that deconstructs the spreadsheet to allow irregular relations, at the same time generalizing the idea to multiple dimensions.
>
> The design is centered on an information structure called a zzstructure and its interactive visualizations. Instead of conventional linear text or tree structures, zzstructure is a multidimensional extension of a spreadsheet whose cells can contain various kinds of data.
>
> Whereas conventional spreadsheet software requires a rectangle of equal-length rows, the ZigZag model holds arbitrary structures of cells—as long as they are orthogonally connected (left edge to right edge, top edge to bottom, and so on in as many dimensions as desired).
>
> At any moment, the display shows any two dimensions in table form, but only existing cells are shown—what would be empty space on a spreadsheet simply does not exist.  Users can pivot the display about any cell to efficiently "rotate" any unseen dimension in place of either visible one, allowing them to browse high dimensional grids in a zigzag manner.
