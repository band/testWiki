# NFTs

> A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique and non-interchangeable datum stored on a digital ledger (blockchain). **NFTs** can be used to represent easily reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files as unique items (analogous to a certificate of authenticity), and use blockchain technology to establish a verified and public proof of ownership. Copies of the original file are not restricted to the owner of the NFT, and can be copied and shared like any file. The lack of interchangeability (fungibility) distinguishes NFTs from blockchain cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.

> The first NFT project was launched in 2015 on the Ethereum blockchain, and interest grew with the rise of interest in crypto currencies. Interest and the total monetary value of NFTs grew significantly in 2021, with sales of NFTs exceeding $2 billion during the first quarter of the yearâ€“more than 20 times that of the previous quarter. NFTs have drawn criticism with respect to the energy cost and carbon footprint associated with validating blockchain transactions.
