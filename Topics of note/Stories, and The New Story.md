# Stories, and The New Story

What is the story that's in place that is so pervasive that people can't talk outside of it? And that story is the story of money and finances, right? ([[Primacy of Money]])

**Our new story has to include a very different paradigm for what's meaningful.**

I'm loving this thread about how can we weave the new story. Connecting to what [[Person/Samuel Rose]] was saying about changing people's perspectives and beliefs. I love what [[Person/Grace Rachmany]] added, from the beginning, that kind of kicked this off.

And I just want to say, I think there are quite a few different frameworks for how we could break up society in a healthier way, like the [[Wheel of Co-Creation]]. I know there are other ones. It might, I'm just want to offer up that.

My thoughts started to go there. We could start with trying to frame a new story, at least in each of these disciplinary areas of society.

I think it's a lot to ask that we come up with some kind of overarching something, but I would love the exercise of trying to at least in some sections. Even if we take what we think the story is now, right? We probably could identify that pretty well. And then try and flip it 180 or something like that.

Almost like a mental exercise of trying to rewrite the story. What would it look like? And what does it sound like? And we don't necessarily need to get to the new story, but it would be a nice exercise to at least start to put a positive spin or a new re-imagining on top of it. I bet this group would be a great group to start to weave that.

There are many, many, many individuals and organizations trying to come up with new stories, and the talk that I've pointed to by [[Person/George Monbiot]], he presents his story. And he contrasts it in story frame to the previous stories that it needs to replace.

I don't know if we need to invent one from whole cloth, and I don't want to stop us from trying, cause it's easy enough to, to generate words and think about them and put them in the world. But there are a bunch of people working on this story or set of stories to figure out how it works. And from my perspective, we are currently living inside of so many different rings of concentric and overlapping and mutually reinforcing cycles of dysfunction.

About whether we're enough. About whether we have enough money. About how to compete in society. About zero sumness. The current logics and means of neoliberal, globalist capitalism and consumerism and all that kind of stuff. They won't all come undone at one time. And I'm extremely interested in finding the subtle small thing that will cause people to start to tip and behave differently in the face of the current system.

And here, one of my heroes is Milton Erickson, who was a hypnotist and therapist back in the day. And he had this way.  His _modus operandi_ was to try to open a conversation with your unconscious, which he did through hypnosis and give your unconscious more options, more behavioral repertory at the moment when you were approaching the thing that you had a problem with.

I'm trying to find what is the subtle knife that lets us do this at a social scale. What is the tiny story that will carry like [[Free Hugs]] carries? Right. Free hugs carried really, really well.

The [[Ice Bucket Challenge]], strangely enough, there's probably a million charities in the world going, why didn't we think of the ice bucket challenge?

That's a [[Meme]] that carried really well, although it wasn't transformative because it was nonsense. It was pouring ice over your head. It wasn't about behavioral change. It was just a way to collect money. But these things really traveled, traveled excellently.
