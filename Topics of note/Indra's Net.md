# Indra's Net

[[Thor]]'s equivalent over in Hindu mythology is Devendra or Indra. And then there's this.

Indra is very interestingly sort of connected to [[Indra's Net]], which is one of the more ancient, motivating... I mean, if a lot of us are motivated by Vannevar Bush's essay or Doug Engelbart's mother of all demos, we should also be likewise motivated by Indra's net, which is this idea of a set of jewels set in a net where each jewel reflects all the other jewels.

That's kind of this [[Holographic Vision Of Knowledge]], of #weaving a new fabric.

I have all these different visions connected under a thought called [Visions That Have Inspired Builders Of Global Brains](https://bra.in/2pxbo6). So here's the [[Book/Magister Ludi]], [[The Glass Bead Game]], [[Person/Doug Engelbart]]'s [[Mother Of All Demos]]. [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[Memex]], the [[Noosphere]] from [[Person/Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]].

> **Indra's Net** (also called Indra's jewels or Indra's pearls, Sanskrit Indrajwāla) is a metaphor used to illustrate the concepts of Śūnyatā (emptiness), pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination), and interpenetration in Buddhist philosophy.

> The metaphor's earliest known reference is found in the Atharva Veda.  It was further developed by the Mahayana school in the 3rd century Avatamsaka Sutra and later by the Huayan school between the 6th and 8th centuries.
