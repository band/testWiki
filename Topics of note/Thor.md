# Thor

## Spelling

Spelled "Tor" in Swedish.

## Story

What happens on the day of the God of thunderstorms? Is there a celebration, or do people go out on the streets and enjoy the rain, or...?

No, the thunderstorms. So a lot of sound, etc. It's coming from when Tor was driving his carriage and made a lot of noise.

What made all that noise? Was it just the mass of the chariot?

Yes, and the hammering on the horses.

## Etymology

The medieval Germanic forms Þórr (Old Norse), Donar (Old High German), Þunor (Old English), Thuner (Old Frisian) and Thunar (Old Saxon) are cognates -- linguistic siblings of the same origin.

They descend from the Proto-Germanic theonym Þun(a)raz ('Thunder'), which is identical to the name of the Celtic god Taranus (by metathesis of Tonaros; cf. OBrit. Tanaro, Gaul. Tanarus), and further related to the Latin epithet Tonans (attached to Jupiter), via the common Proto-Indo-European root for 'thunder' (s)tenh₂-.

According to scholar Peter Jackson, those theonyms may have originally emerged as the result of the fossilization of an original epithet (or epiclesis) of the Proto-Indo-European thunder-god Perkwunos, since the Vedic weather-god Parjanya is also called stanayitnú- ('Thunderer').
