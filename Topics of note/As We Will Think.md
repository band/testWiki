# As We Will Think

Paper by [[Person/Ted Nelson]].

This paper expands on the classic article [[As We Will Think]] by [[Person/Vannevar Bush]] (1945), which inspired [[Person/Doug Engelbart]] as well as Ted Nelson.  What kind of hypertext did Bush foresee?  And what kind do we need?

[As We Will Think-- 1972 version, with parallel illustrations](https://archive.org/details/AsWeWillThink1972WithParallelPix) - _Parallel pages on the screen, with visible connections, is a central idea in my work.  (We may call such pages "parallel hypertext"; Jason Scott has kindly suggested calling such pages "Nelson documents".) This 1972 article, with two photographs of a simulated interactive screen, is the first publication that made the idea of connected screen pages clear and explicit.  The two photographs simulating connected pages are near the end of the document.  (A third photograph was submitted but not included by the editors.)_
