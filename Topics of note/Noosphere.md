# Noosphere

Alternate spelling: no√∂sphere

The #noosphere is a philosophical concept developed and popularized by the Russian-Ukrainian Soviet biogeochemist [[Person/Vladimir Vernadsky]], and the French philosopher and Jesuit priest [[Person/Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. Vernadsky defined the noosphere as the new state of the #biosphere and described as the planetary "sphere of reason". The noosphere represents the highest stage of biospheric development, its defining factor being the development of humankind's rational activities.
