# Heroes

 In some respects we have to kill the [[Hero's Journey]] and [[Heroes|the hero]], because the hero can't save us. It's a complete mythology. How can we shift beyond this to stories of "heroicism with the royal we."
 
 A couple of books that came to mind as I was thinking about what I was going to say was how can we create living story and movements based upon the [[Book/Open Innovation]] book of [[Person/Henry Chesbrough]], and also [[Person/John Doerr]]'s book [[Book/Measure What Matters]], because that provides a framework for innovation.
 
 How can we scale up the #innovation capacities and capabilities of ordinary people?
 
 Because that's the only way that we're going to scale up something that's going to have any measure of #mitigating against the #disasters we're going to be facing in the #future with the [[Climate Problem]].
