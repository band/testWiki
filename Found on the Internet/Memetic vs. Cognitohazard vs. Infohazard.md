# Memetic vs. Cognitohazard vs. Infohazard

**[Memetic vs. Cognitohazard vs. Infohazard](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-578967/memetic-vs-cognitohazard-vs-infohazard#post-1602021)** (2012-10-30)

A *cognitohazard* poses a danger when sensed. This can be via any of the classical senses: sight, sound, hearing, taste, or touch. As the FAQ explains, this isn't necessarily only mind-affecting. [SCP-740](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-740) (The Hindenburg Photograph) is a perfect example of a *cognitohazard*.

A *memetic* agent is "infectious information", knowledge that triggers anomalous behavior or effects. By nature, all *memetic* agents are cognitohazards; you have to sense something to learn new information. [SCP-571](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-571) (Self-Propagating Infecious Pattern) is a definitive *memetic* agent.

An *infohazard*, as coined by Sorts, is something that is triggered if you simply know about it. It is similar to but distinct from a *memetic* agent because a *memetic* agent is pure information whereas an *infohazard* is generally an object. [SCP-426](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-426) (I Am A Toaster) is a perfect example of this.
