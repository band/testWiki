# 2022-03-23 notes

Some notes for MW Wednesday:

1. it's a fool's errand to expect group collaboration around annotation and extended commentary on "sensemaking"
2. perhaps we can find an AI or ML tool to dump a bunch of messages into and see what can come from that?
3. It was mentioned that "weaving" was happening on the OGM list. I don't think there is any weaving; just a pile of threads.
