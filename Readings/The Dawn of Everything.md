Title: The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity

Authors: [[Person/David Graeber]], [[Person/David Wengrow]]

I've been reading David Graber's new book, The Dawn of Everything, which is stunning and deeply important. Um, one reviewer compared it to Galileo and Darwin, which I think is not a huge overreach.

Giulio Ongaro, Jacobin:

> An instant classic . . . Fatalistic sentiments about human nature melt away upon turning the pages . . . [The Dawn of Everything] sits in a different class to all the other volumes on world history we are accustomed to reading . . . If comparisons must be made, they should be made with works of similar caliber in other fields, most credibly, I venture, with the works of Galileo or Darwin. Graeber and Wengrow do to human history what the first two did to astronomy and biology respectively.

> **The Dawn of Everything**: A New History of Humanity is a 2021 book by anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow. It will be published in the United States on November 9, 2021, by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.Drawing attention to the diversity of early human societies, it critiques traditional narratives of history's linear development from primitivism to civilization. Instead, The Dawn of Everything posits that humans lived in large, complex, but decentralized polities for millennia. It relies on archaeological evidence to show that early societies were diverse and developed numerous political structures. Graeber and Wengrow finished the book around August 2020. Its American edition is 704 pages long, with a 63-page bibliography.
