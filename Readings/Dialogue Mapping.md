# Dialogue Mapping

- comes from work of [[Person/Jeff Conklin]] Dialogue Mapping:  Building Shared Understanding of Wicked Problems
- implies underlying architecture of knowledge to capture
- assumes explicit knowledge of or a process to get to asking useful [[Questions]]
- If questions not framed, dialogues lack shape and cannot easily be structured for decisionmaking ie you can't map the dialogue using this method and it is difficult to timebox the exchange
