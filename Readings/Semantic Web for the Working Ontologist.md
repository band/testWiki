p. 11: Fundamental concepts of the Semantic Web:

*The AAA slogan* -- Anyone can say Anything about Any topic. One of the basic tenets of the Web in general and the Semantice Web in particular.

*Open world/Closed world* -- A consequence of the AAA slogan is that there could always be something new that someone will say: this means that we must assume that there is always more information that could be known.

*Nonunique naming* -- Since the speakers on the Web won't necessarily coordinate their naming efforts, the same entity could be known by more than one name.

*The network effect* -- The property of a web that makes it grow organically. The value of joining in increases with the number of people who have joined, resulting in a virtuous cycle of participation.

*The data wilderness* -- The condition of most data on the web. It contains valuable information, but there is no guarantee that it will be orderly or readily understandable.

The Web of today is something of an unruly place, with a wide variety of different sources, organizations, and sytles of information.
