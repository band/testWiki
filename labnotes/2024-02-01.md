1. today's insight into how to use masWiki PyPI package with netlify:
 - initialize to install the theme and setup the configuration file  
 - create, or install a `requirements.txt` that looks like this:  
 ```
 MasWiki==1.0.1
 ```
   or whatever the version number needs to be.
   
  - this will allow `netlify` to pip install the package and run it to
    build the website.  
	(at least that is my current understanding)  
	
2. today's work was to add the `.maswiki` directory and a `.gitignore`
   file to the repo  
   
   - maybe tomorrow we experiment with getting node_modules set up
